## SATRE Architecture

The current version of the architecture can be viewed on [the main SATRE specification site](https://satre-archimate.readthedocs.io/latest/)

 Standard Architecture for Trusted Research Environments (TREs) provides a comprehensive high-level architecture for research organisations handling sensitive data safely. The architecture is documented using the ArchiMate modelling language with models created using the open source modelling tool [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

Capabilities an organisation requires to run a TRE are documented and deconstructed to show the elements (Roles, processes, applications and data) needed to realise those capabilities.
